# Here's some new strange stuff, remember  to type it exactly,

#Assign Variable "days" to the string of 7 days of the week
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thur Fri Sat Sun"
#Assign variable "months" to the string jan to Aug
#with with each month starting on a new line "\n"
months = "\nJan\nFeb\n\"\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Display or print the days by using content of variable days
print(f"Here are the days:  {days}")
# Display or print the months by calling the content of variable "months"
print("Here are the months: ", months)

# weird, still working this one out
print("""
There's " many many" blah... something going on here.
With three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.

""")
